# About

Clarity is a clean and responsive WordPress theme.

It uses [the Skeleton CSS framework](http://www.getskeleton.com/) as a grid system which provides the responsive layout.

[MooTools](http://mootools.net/) is also used for the drop down menu system.

The [HTML5 enabling script](http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/) is also included to allow the use of HTML5 elements in older browsers.
